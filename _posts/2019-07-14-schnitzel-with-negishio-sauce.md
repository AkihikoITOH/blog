This time I combined beloved Schnitzel Wiener Art with one of my favorite sauce from my homeland Japan - "Negi-shio".
It literally means "Green onion & salt" sauce, however, it doesn't necessarily mean it has to be overly salty.
It merely means the sauce does not contain soy sauce or miso which are both common ingredients used to add salty taste to Japanese dishes.

# Ingredients for the sauce

- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic, chopped
- Green onion, chopped
- Lemon juice
- Sesami oil
- Sake

To be honest I haven't figured out the perfect recipe of the sauce yet.
This time I put a little too much lemon juice and made it too sour.
It still went quite well with the Schnitzel though - the refreshing flavors of lemon and green onion stirred up my appetite.
