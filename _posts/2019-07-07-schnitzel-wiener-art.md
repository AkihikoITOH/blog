For the first attempt I cooked traditional Schnitzel Wiener Art - pork slice coated with breadcrumb and fried, served with lemon wedges.

# Ingredients

- Pork slices (Minutensteak)
- Lemon
- Cooking oil
- Coating
  - Flour
  - Egg(s) - I used just one for four slices of meat, about 100g each
  - Cream (Schlagsahne - not whipped)
  - Fine-grained breadcrumb (Paniermehl)

- Seasoning
  - Salt
  - Pepper

# Processes

1. Season the meat
: Sprinkle good amount of salt and pepper on both sides of the meat.

2. Prepare the coating
: Mix eggs and cream in a bowl.
: Put flour on a plate, and put breadcrumb on another plate.

3. Apply the coating
: First cover the meat with flour, then dunk it in the egg-cream mix and finally cover it with breadcrumb.
: Leave the meat for some minutes for the coating to settle.

4. Fry
: Pour about 1cm deep of cooking oil in a pan and heat it up.
: Fry the meat, several minutes each side, until the coating becomes brown and crunchy.
: You want it to be crunchy outside and tender and juicy inside.
