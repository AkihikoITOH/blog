I happened to remember I had Brathähnchen (grilled chicken) spice at home which I don't really see a chance to use in the near future.
Therefore I decided to use the spice to add a slight twist to Schnitzel.

I mixed the spice with the flour in order to not make it too Brathähnchen-ish. I also sprinkled less salt and pepper on the meat than usual, since the spice contains them.

The spice was subtle, yet added rich flavor to the Schnitzel which otherwise could be a little boring.
It probably is going to be my standard way of making a Schnitzel.
