I've been fascinated by [Schnitzel][schnitzel_wikipedia] since I moved to Germany.
It's so simple yet very diverse. Also the similarities with Japanese Tonkatsu which is another favorite food of mine gives me inspirations for possible Schnitzel variants.

I'm going to try cooking Schnitzel myself - from traditional JÃ¤gerschnitzel and Wienerschnitzel to any unconventional variants I can come up with.
